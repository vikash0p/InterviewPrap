      "Functional components may re-render more frequently if not optimized with hooks like useCallback and useMemo. They can be less efficient than class components if not handled properly.",

    description:
      "Managing complex state logic can be trickier in functional components, requiring hooks like useReducer and useContext, which may add more boilerplate code.",

      "Functional components donâ€™t have access to the this keyword, unlike class components. Instead, useRef is used to reference DOM elements or mutable values.",

      "Event handlers can require extra steps to optimize performance in functional components, particularly when using useCallback to memoize functions.",

      "Functional components encourage splitting code into smaller pieces, which can lead to deep component trees, making them harder to manage.",

      "Overuse of hooks in large applications can increase complexity and make code harder to maintain, especially if several hooks are needed in a single component.",
