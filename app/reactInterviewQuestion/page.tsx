            React is an efficient, flexible, and open-source JavaScript
            framework library that allows developers to the creation of simple,
            fast, and scalable web applications. Jordan Walke, a software
            engineer who was working for Facebook created React. It was first
            deployed on the news feed of Facebook in 2011 and on Instagram in
            2012. Developers from the Javascript background can easily develop
            web applications with the help of React.

            React Hooks will allow you to use the state and other features of
            React in which requires a class to be written by you. In simple
            words, we can say that, React Hooks are the functions that will
            connect React state with the lifecycle features from the function
            components. React Hooks is among the features that are implemented
            latest in the version React 16.8.

            Scope of React: The selection of the right technology for
            application or web development is becoming more challenging. React
            has been considered to be the fastest-growing Javascript framework
            among all. The tools of Javascript are firming their roots slowly
            and steadily in the marketplace and the React certification demand
            is exponentially increasing. React is a clear win for front-end
            developers as it has a quick learning curve, clean abstraction, and
            reusable components. Currently, there is no end in sight for React
            as it keeps evolving.
