          JavaScript is a versatile, high-level programming language primarily
          used for creating interactive and dynamic content on the web. It
          enables developers to implement features like real-time updates,
          interactive forms, animations, and more. JavaScript is supported by
          all major web browsers and can be used alongside HTML and CSS to build
          modern, responsive web applications. With the rise of frameworks like
          React, Angular, and Vue, JavaScript has become an essential tool for
          front-end as well as back-end development (e.g., using Node.js).
